# OpenCommit-
 a task-based, micro-collaboration platform for coding projects, which breaks down projects into smaller units (like GitHub issues or Trello cards), and lets freelancers or contributors pick up and complete individual tasks to earn a pre-set reward. It's like merging GitHub, Upwork, and bounties into one system.
